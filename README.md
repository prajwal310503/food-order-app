# Food Order Web App

# I developed a food ordering web app named "Food Wagon", which features a burger logo and is hosted on Firebase. The app is designed to offer a seamless user experience for ordering food online.

# 1.The Home Page includes several key sections:

**Banner Section**: A visually appealing introduction to the website.

**Categories:** Different food categories to help users navigate easily.

**Popular Items:** A showcase of trending dishes.

**Footer:** Includes services like catering, fast delivery, online ordering, and gift cards.

The **Navbar** contains links to Home, Menu, Services, and Offers, along with a search button, cart button, and profile icon.





# 2.Menu Section:

In the Menu Section, users can explore food items categorized into salads, soups, pizzas, desserts, and drinks.

The menu offers filtering options based on name (A-Z) and price (low to high, high to low), with pagination at the bottom for easy navigation.




# 3.Add to Cart & Cart Management:

Users can add items to the cart. If theyâ€™re not logged in, a popup prompts them to log in first.

After logging in, adding items to the cart triggers a confirmation message.

**The Cart Page displays:**
**Item details:** Image, name, quantity (with options to increase), price, and a remove option.

**Customer & Shopping Details:** Total items, total price, and a "Proceed to Checkout" button.




# 4.Authentication System:

The website includes a robust authentication system.

Users can sign up and log in using their email and password or directly via a Google account.





# 5.Admin Panel:

The Admin Panel is accessible only to admins via the profile button. Regular users are redirected to the home page if they try to access it.

**Admin Features include:**
Revenue Monitoring: View the revenue generated.

**User Management:** View and manage users, including their roles (user/admin) and delete options.

**Order Management:** View and manage all orders, including transaction ID, price, order status (pending/confirmed), and removal.

**Menu Management**: Add new menu items (with options to categorize, price, and upload images), update existing items, and delete items with confirmation popups.




# 6.Technology Stack:

The app is built using Tailwind CSS, Vite + React, and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), ensuring a modern, responsive, and efficient web application.
